	abstract = {It is accepted that many evolutionary changes of amino acid sequence in proteins are conservative: the replacement of one amino acid by another residue has a far greater chance of being accepted if the two residues have similar properties. It is difficult, however, to identify relevant physicochemical properties that capture this similarity. In this paper we introduce a criterion that determines similarity from an evolutionary point of view. Our criterion is based on the description of protein evolution by a Markov process and the corresponding matrix of instantaneous replacement rates. It is inspired by the conductance, a quantity that reflects the strength of mixing in a Markov process. Furthermore we introduce a method to divide the 20 amino acid residues into subsets that achieve good scores with our criterion. The criterion has the time-invariance property that different time distances of the same amino acid replacement rate matrix lead to the same grouping; but different rate matrices lead to different groupings. Therefore it can be used as an automated method to compare matrices derived from consideration of different types of proteins, or from parts of proteins sharing different structural or functional features. We present the groupings resulting from two standard matrices used in sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree estimation.},

The atomic architecture of a spine, from the fibril-forming segment GNNQQNY of the yeast prion protein Sup35, was recently revealed by X-ray microcrystallography. It is a pair of β-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated in a dry ‘steric zipper’. Here we report some 30 other segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both. These include segments from the Alzheimer’s amyloid-β and tau proteins, the PrP prion protein, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), lysozyme, myoglobin, α-synuclein and β2-microglobulin, suggesting that common structural features are shared by amyloid diseases at the molecular level. Structures of 13 of these microcrystals all reveal steric zippers, but with variations that expand the range of atomic architectures for amyloid-like fibrils and offer an atomic-level hypothesis for the basis of prion strains.},

arginine (R) residue in the sequence of Aβ42 adopts abundant
β-sheet structure and forms stable salt bridges with various
residues. Furthermore, experiments proposed that R stimulates the
Aβ assembly and arginine (R) to alanine (A) mutation (R5A) decreases
both aggregate formation tendency and the degree of its toxicity.
However, the exact roles of R and R5A mutation in the structures of
Aβ42 are poorly understood. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations
along with thermodynamic calculations present that R5A mutation impacts
the structures and free energy landscapes of the aqueous Aβ42
peptide. The β-sheet structure almost disappears in the Ala21–Ala30
region but is more abundant in parts of the central hydrophobic core
and C-terminal regions of Aβ42 upon R5A mutation. More abundant
α-helix is adopted in parts of the N-terminal and mid-domain
regions and less prominent α-helix formation occurs in the central
hydrophobic core region of Aβ42 upon R5A mutation. Interestingly,
intramolecular interactions between N- and C-terminal or mid-domain
regions disappear upon R5A mutation. The structures of Aβ42
are thermodynamically less stable and retain reduced compactness upon
R5A mutation. R5A mutant-type structure stability increases with more
prominent central hydrophobic core and mid-domain or C-terminal region
interactions. Based on our results reported in this work, small organic
molecules and antibodies that avoid β-sheet formation in the
Ala21–Ala30 region and hinder the intramolecular interactions
occurring between the N-terminal and mid-domain or C-terminal regions
of Aβ42 may help to reduce Aβ42 toxicity in Alzheimer’s
disease.},

	abstract = {Aromatic amino acids strongly promote cross-β amyloid formation; whether the amyloidogenicity of aromatic residues is due to high hydrophobicity and β-sheet propensity or formation of stabilizing π-π interactions has been debated. To clarify the role of aromatic residues on amyloid formation, the islet amyloid polypeptide 20-29 fragment [IAPP(20-29)], which contains a single aromatic residue (Phe 23), was adopted as a model. The side chain of residue 23 does not self-associate in cross-β fibrils of IAPP(20-29) (Nielsen et al., Angew Chem Int Ed 2009;48:2118-2121), allowing investigation of the amyloidogenicity of aromatic amino acids in a context where direct π-π interactions do not occur. We prepared variants of IAPP(20-29) in which Tyr, Leu, Phe, pentafluorophenylalanine (F5-Phe), Trp, cyclohexylalanine (Cha), α-naphthylalanine (1-Nap), or β-naphthylalanine (2-Nap) (in order of increasing peptide hydrophobicity) were incorporated at position 23 (SNNXGAILSS-NH2), and the kinetic and thermodynamic effects of these mutations on cross-β self-assembly were assessed. The Tyr, Leu, and Trp 23 variants failed to readily self-assemble at concentrations up to 1.5 mM, while the Cha 23 mutant fibrillized with attenuated kinetics and similar thermodynamic stability relative to the wild-type Phe 23 peptide. Conversely, the F5-Phe, 1-Nap, and 2-Nap 23 variants self-assembled at enhanced rates, forming fibrils with greater thermodynamic stability than the wild-type peptide. These results indicate that the high amyloidogenicity of aromatic amino acids is a function of hydrophobicity, β-sheet propensity, and planar geometry and not the ability to form stabilizing or directing π-π bonds.},

	abstract = {Identification of therapeutic strategies to prevent or cure diseases associated with amyloid fibril deposition in tissue (Alzheimer's disease, spongiform encephalopathies, etc.) requires a rational understanding of the driving forces involved in the formation of these organized assemblies rich in beta-sheet structure. To this end, we used a computer-designed algorithm to search for hexapeptide sequences with a high propensity to form homopolymeric beta-sheets. Sequences predicted to be highly favorable on this basis were found experimentally to self-associate efficiently into beta-sheets, whereas point mutations predicted to be unfavorable for this structure inhibited polymerization. However, the property to form polymeric beta-sheets is not a sufficient requirement for fibril formation because, under the conditions used here, preformed beta-sheets from these peptides with charged residues form well defined fibrils only if the total net charge of the molecule is +/-1. This finding illustrates the delicate balance of interactions involved in the formation of fibrils relative to more disordered aggregates. The present results, in conjunction with x-ray fiber diffraction, electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, have allowed us to propose a detailed structural model of the fibrils.},

Amyloid fibrils derived from different amyloidogenic proteins share structural elements including beta-sheet secondary structure and similar tertiary structure. While some amyloidogenic proteins are rich in beta-sheet in their soluble form, others, like Alzheimer beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) or serum amyloid A, must undergo significant structural transition to acquire a high beta-sheet content. We postulate that Abeta and other amyloidogenic proteins undergo a transition to beta-sheet as a result of aging-related chemical modifications of aspartyl residues to the form of succinimide or isoaspartyl methyl ester. We hypothesize that spontaneous cyclization of aspartate residues in amyloidogenic proteins can serve as a nucleation event in amyloidogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a series of designed peptides having the sequence VTVKVXAVKVTV, where X represents aspartic acid or its derivatives. Studies using circular dichroism showed that neutralization of the aspartate residue through the formation of a methyl ester or an amide, or replacement of aspartate with glutamate led to an increased beta-sheet content at neutral and basic pH. A higher content of beta-sheet structure correlated with increased propensity for fibril formation and decreased solubility at neutral pH.},

To assess the genetic stability of the UL5 and UL29 transgenes in AV529-19 cells, a digital PCR-based approach was developed. During characterization of the test method, the specificity, accuracy, and intermediate precision of the assay was investigated based on regulatory guidelines. The developed assay was used to monitor the stability of the transgenes in the manufactured AV529-19 cell lines by comparison of transgene copy numbers in the master cell bank (MCB) with their copy numbers in the extended cell bank (ECB). Results showed that the UL29 and UL5 transgenes are stable in that there are one and three copies of the UL29 and UL5 genes, respectively, per cell in both the AV529-19 MCB and ECB.},

	abstract = {For several decades scientists have speculated that the key to understanding age-related neurodegenerative disorders may be found in the unusual biology of the prion diseases. Recently, owing largely to the advent of new disease models, this hypothesis has gained experimental momentum. In a remarkable variety of diseases, specific proteins have been found to misfold and aggregate into seeds that structurally corrupt like proteins, causing them to aggregate and form pathogenic assemblies ranging from small oligomers to large masses of amyloid. Proteinaceous seeds can therefore serve as self-propagating agents for the instigation and progression of disease. Alzheimer's disease and other cerebral proteopathies seem to arise from the de novo misfolding and sustained corruption of endogenous proteins, whereas prion diseases can also be infectious in origin. However, the outcome in all cases is the functional compromise of the nervous system, because the aggregated proteins gain a toxic function and/or lose their normal function. As a unifying pathogenic principle, the prion paradigm suggests broadly relevant therapeutic directions for a large class of currently intractable diseases.},

The ability of these soluble β-sheet conformers to induce neuronal damage has been investigated in direct challenge with the monomeric and fibrillary structures, showing that only the oligomeric species affected the neurons. β amyloid oligomers were initially purified from Alzheimer brains and obtained using synthetic peptides. Together with the neuronal death, synaptic dysfunction, loss of spines, and LTP impairment were seen with the direct application of β amyloid oligomers. Similar results have been described with proteins associated with other neurodegenerative disorders. The biological activities of oligomeric forms of α synuclein have been described in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Detrimental effects have been associated with the oligomeric forms of prion, tau, and huntingtin, the key proteins in prion diseases, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease, respectively. The molecular mechanisms of the oligomer-related toxic effects can be summarized under three headings: nonspecific perturbance of cellular and intracellular membranes, specific interaction with various cellular entities, and amyloid pore channel formation. To characterize and distinguish oligomer actions better, we compared the ability of β amyloid and α synuclein oligomers to induce cognitive impairment when applied directly into the brain in the same acute mouse model.

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four amniocentesis and 16 chorionic villus samples were used for microfluidic digital PCR analysis. Three thousand and sixty PCR reactions were performed for each of the target chromosomes (X, Y, 13, 18, and 21), and the number of single molecule amplifications was compared to a reference. The difference between target and reference chromosome counts was used to determine the ploidy of each of the target chromosomes.
RESULTS: Digital PCR accurately identified all cases of fetal trisomy (3 cases of trisomy 21, 3 cases of trisomy 18, and 2 cases of triosmy 13) in the 40 specimens analyzed. The remaining specimens were determined to have normal ploidy for the chromosomes tested.
CONCLUSION: Microfluidic digital PCR allows detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy utilizing uncultured amniocytes and chorionic villus tissue in less than 6 hours.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: : To distinguish the cis-trans relationship of two sequence changes and to arrive at an accurate molecular diagnosis for autosomal recessive disorders, methods such as Sanger sequencing cannot differentiate whether sequence changes are in cis or trans. In addition, most techniques theoretically appropriate for allelic discrimination depend on the specific identified sequence changes for assay design, need extensive optimization, or may not be suitable. We developed a method that does not fully depend on the specific nucleotide changes. It enables efficient assay design and practical implementation of allelic discrimination.
METHODS: : Digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to separate and amplify alleles. Sanger sequencing was subsequently used to identify sequence changes.
RESULTS: : We developed a cost-effective digital PCR method for allelic discrimination of short amplicons and demonstrated it with p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in GJB2 as an example. We also successfully developed a long-range digital PCR approach to determine the cis-trans relationship of p.Arg117His and 5T in the CFTR gene.
CONCLUSION: : Digital PCR for allelic discrimination can be clinically implemented to determine the allelic configuration of relatively common sequence changes which frequently appear together and have clinical ramifications, such as the combination of p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in the GJB2 gene and p.Arg117His and 5T in CFTR.},

PCR solution is distributed throughout numerous partitions, and following amplification, target DNA copy number is estimated based on the proportion of partitions containing amplified DNA. Here, we identify approaches for obtaining reliable digital PCR data. Single molecule amplification efficiency was significantly improved following fragmentation of total DNA and bias in copy number estimates reduced by analysis of short intact target DNA fragments. Random and independent distribution of target DNA molecules throughout partitions, which is critical to accurate digital PCR measurement, was demonstrated by spatial distribution analysis. The estimated relative uncertainty for target DNA concentration was under 6\% when analyzing five digital panels comprising 765 partitions each, provided the panels contained an average of 212 to 3,365 template molecules. Partition volume was a major component of this uncertainty estimate. These findings can be applied to other digital PCR studies to improve confidence in such measurements.},

	abstract = {Quantification of genomic DNA that is traceable to the SI was performed successfully by measuring the individual nucleotides. Specifically, ultrasound was used to shear lambda genomic DNA into fragments of less than 200 base pairs, followed by deoxyribonuclease Ι and phosphodiesterase Ι digestion and liquid chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry (LC-IDMS) quantification to estimate the mass fraction of the lambda DNA, based on the constituent deoxynucleotide monophosphates (dNMPs) within the molecule. Digital PCR (dPCR) was employed to quantify the same lambda DNA solution to provide independent data for comparing the performance of two quantitative methods. On the basis of the LC-IDMS measurement after ultrasonic treatment of the sample, the concentration of lambda DNA was 273.1 ± 9.8 μg/g (expanded uncertainty at the 95\% confidence interval). This shows good agreement with the data from dPCR. Additionally, the result calculated on the basis of the sum of the concentrations of the four dNMPs is the same as that calculated on the basis of the sequence, which indicates that knowledge of the DNA sequence and length is unnecessary to measure the total DNA concentration when applying ultrasonic treatment-LC-IDMS.},

This chip is part of a family of integrated fluidic circuits (IFC) and contains a network of fluid lines, NanoFlex™ valves and chambers. NanoFlex™ valves are made of an elastomeric material that deflects under pressure to create a tight seal and are used to regulate the flow of liquids in the IFC. Digital Arrays have enabled a different approach to digital PCR, by partitioning DNA molecules instead of diluting them. Single DNA molecules are randomly distributed into nanoliter volume reaction chambers and then PCR amplified in the presence of a fluorophore-containing probe. Positive fluorescent signal indicates the presence of a DNA molecule in a reaction chamber, while negative chambers are blank. IFC technology enables the delivery of very precise volumes of solutions in a simple, fast procedure, utilizing a minimum of sample and assay reagents. The development of the IFC technology and the Digital Array chip has revolutionized the field of biology, and has been utilized in gene copy number studies, absolute quantitation (molecule counting) of genomic DNA and cDNA, rare mutation detection, and digital haplotyping.},

Most approaches, however, reply on optimal starting DNA, and are therefore unsuitable for the analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, which largely precludes the analysis of many tumour series. We have sought to challenge the limits of this technique with regards to quality and quantity of starting material and the depth of sequencing required. We confirm that the technique can be used to interrogate DNA from cell lines, fresh frozen material and FFPE samples to assess copy number variation. We show that as little as 5 ng of DNA is needed to generate a copy number karyogram, and follow this up with data from a series of FFPE biopsies and surgical samples. We have used various levels of sample multiplexing to demonstrate the adjustable resolution of the methodology, depending on the number of samples and available resources. We also demonstrate reproducibility by use of replicate samples and comparison with microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and digital PCR. This technique can be valuable in both the analysis of routine diagnostic samples and in examining large repositories of fixed archival material.},

	doi = {10.1373/clinchem.2009.132662},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal plasma mRNA encoded by the PLAC4 gene (placenta-specific 4), which is transcribed from chromosome 21 in placental cells, is a potential marker for the noninvasive assessment of chromosome 21 dosage in the fetus. We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of 2 trisomy 21-screening approaches that use maternal plasma PLAC4 mRNA.
METHODS: We studied maternal plasma samples from 153 pregnant women carrying euploid and trisomy 21 fetuses. For the samples in which the fetuses were heterozygous for the studied PLAC4 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we measured the ratio between 2 alleles of the SNP in maternal plasma PLAC4 mRNA (RNA-SNP) by mass spectrometric (MS) and digital PCR methods. For pregnancies involving fetuses homozygous for the SNP, we quantified the total PLAC4 mRNA concentration in maternal plasma by real-time PCR and digital PCR.
RESULTS: For the RNA-SNP approach, we achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100\% (95\% CI, 40.2\%-100\%) and 89.7\% (95\% CI, 78.8\%-96.1\%), respectively, for both the MS and the digital PCR methods. For the mRNA-quantification approach, the areas under the ROC curves were 0.859 (95\% CI, 0.741-0.903) and 0.833 (95\% CI, 0.770-0.923) for plasma PLAC4 mRNA concentrations measured by the real-time PCR and the digital PCR methods, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For prenatal screening of trisomy 21, the quantification of the total PLAC4 mRNA concentration can be used in a synergistic manner with the RNA-SNP allelic ratio approach to increase the population coverage of cases in which diagnostic information can be obtained.},

To date, several reduced amino acid alphabets have been proposed, which have been derived and optimized by a variety of methods. The resulting reduced amino acid alphabets have been applied to pattern recognition, generation of consensus sequences from multiple alignments, protein folding, and protein structure prediction. In this work, amino acid substitution matrices and statistical potentials were derived based on several reduced amino acid alphabets and their performance assessed in a large benchmark for the tasks of sequence alignment and fold assessment of protein structure models, using as a reference frame the standard alphabet of 20 amino acids. The results showed that a large reduction in the total number of residue types does not necessarily translate into a significant loss of discriminative power for sequence alignment and fold assessment. Therefore, some definitions of a few residue types are able to encode most of the relevant sequence/structure information that is present in the 20 standard amino acids. Based on these results, we suggest that the use of reduced amino acid alphabets may allow to increasing the accuracy of current substitution matrices and statistical potentials for the prediction of protein structure of remote homologs.},

	abstract = {Background
Amyloids are proteins capable of forming aberrant intramolecular contact sites, characteristic of beta zipper configuration. Amyloids can underlie serious health conditions, e.g. Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases. It has been proposed that short segments of amino acids can be responsible for protein amyloidogenicity, but no more than two hundred such hexapeptides have been experimentally found. The authors of the computational tool Pafig published in BMC Bioinformatics a method for extending the amyloid hexapeptide dataset that could be used for training and testing models. They assumed that all hexapeptides belonging to an amyloid protein can be regarded as amylopositive, while those from proteins never reported as amyloid are always amylonegative. Here we show why the above described method of extending datasets is wrong and discuss the reasons why the incorrect data could lead to falsely correct classification.

Results
The amyloid classification of hexapeptides by Pafig was confronted with the classification results from different state of the art computational methods and the outputs of all methods were studied by clustering analysis. The clustering methods show that Pafig is an outlier with regard to other approaches. Our study of the statistical patterns of its training and testing datasets showed a strong bias towards STVIIE hexapeptide in their positive part. Different statistical patterns of seemingly amylo -positive and -negative hexapeptides allow for a repeatable classification, which is not related to amyloid propensity of the hexapetides.

Conclusions
Our study on recognition of amyloid hexapeptides showed that occurrence of incidental patterns in wrongly selected datasets can produce falsely correct results of classification. The assumption that all hexapeptides belonging to amyloid protein can be regarded as amylopositive and those from proteins never reported as amyloid are always amylonegative is not supported by any other computational method. This is in line with experimental observations that amyloid propensity of a full protein can result from only one amyloidogenic fragment in this protein, while the occurrence of amyliodogenic part that is well hidden inside the protein may never lead to fibril formation. This leads to the conclusion that Pafig does not provide correct classification with regard to amyloidogenicity.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Having developed these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of goodness of ?t than was possible in the 2nd Edition, and in Chapter 15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques.

These parameters are able conveniently to provide a scale for the side-chain contribution to protein stability.

Equally, a range of species formed by the same disease associated amyloid sequences have been found to be relatively benign under comparable monomer equivalent concentrations and conditions. In recent years, an increasing number of functional amyloid systems have also been found. These developments show that not all amyloid structures are generically toxic to cells. Given these observations, it is important to understand why amyloid structures may encode such varied toxic potential despite sharing a common core molecular architecture. Here, we discuss possible links between different aspects of amyloidogenic structures and assembly mechanisms with their varied functional effects.

Another factor is sufficient conformational freedom of the self-complementary segment to interact with other molecules. Using RNase A as a model system, we validate our fibrillogenic predictions by the 3D profile method based on the crystal structure of NNQQNY and demonstrate that a specific residue order is required for fiber formation. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that self-complementary segments are found in almost all proteins, yet not all proteins form amyloids.

	abstract = {The supersecondary structure of amyloids and prions, proteins of intense clinical and biological interest, are difficult to determine by standard experimental or computational means. In addition, significant conformational heterogeneity is known or suspected to exist in many amyloid fibrils. Previous work has demonstrated that probability-based prediction of discrete β-strand pairs can offer insight into these structures. Here, we devise a system of energetic rules that can be used to dynamically assemble these discrete β-strand pairs into complete amyloid β-structures. The STITCHER algorithm progressively 'stitches' strand-pairs into full β-sheets based on a novel free-energy model, incorporating experimentally observed amino-acid side-chain stacking contributions, entropic estimates, and steric restrictions for amyloidal parallel β-sheet construction. A dynamic program computes the top 50 structures and returns both the highest scoring structure and a consensus structure taken by polling this list for common discrete elements. Putative structural heterogeneity can be inferred from sequence regions that compose poorly. Predictions show agreement with experimental models of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide and the Podospora anserina Het-s prion. Predictions of the HET-s homolog HET-S also reflect experimental observations of poor amyloid formation. We put forward predicted structures for the yeast prion Sup35, suggesting N-terminal structural stability enabled by tyrosine ladders, and C-terminal heterogeneity. Predictions for the Rnq1 prion and alpha-synuclein are also given, identifying a similar mix of homogenous and heterogeneous secondary structure elements. STITCHER provides novel insight into the energetic basis of amyloid structure, provides accurate structure predictions, and can help guide future experimental studies.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Proteins of all kinds can self-assemble into highly ordered β-sheet aggregates known as amyloid fibrils, important both biologically and clinically. However, the specific molecular structure of a fibril can vary dramatically depending on sequence and environmental conditions, and mutations can drastically alter amyloid function and pathogenicity. Experimental structure determination has proven extremely difficult with only a handful of NMR-based models proposed, suggesting a need for computational methods. Results: We present AmyloidMutants, a statistical mechanics approach for de novo prediction and analysis of wild-type and mutant amyloid structures. Based on the premise of protein mutational landscapes, AmyloidMutants energetically quantifies the effects of sequence mutation on fibril conformation and stability. Tested on non-mutant, full-length amyloid structures with known chemical shift data, AmyloidMutants offers roughly 2-fold improvement in prediction accuracy over existing tools. Moreover, AmyloidMutants is the only method to predict complete super-secondary structures, enabling accurate discrimination of topologically dissimilar amyloid conformations that correspond to the same sequence locations. Applied to mutant prediction, AmyloidMutants identifies a global conformational switch between Aβ and its highly-toxic ‘Iowa’ mutant in agreement with a recent experimental model based on partial chemical shift data. Predictions on mutant, yeast-toxic strains of HET-s suggest similar alternate folds. When applied to HET-s and a HET-s mutant with core asparagines replaced by glutamines (both highly amyloidogenic chemically similar residues abundant in many amyloids), AmyloidMutants surprisingly predicts a greatly reduced capacity of the glutamine mutant to form amyloid. We confirm this finding by conducting mutagenesis experiments. Availability: Our tool is publically available on the web at http://amyloid.csail.mit.edu/.

This estimate is based on the observation that there is little loss of the information necessary to pick out structural homologs in a clustered protein sequence database when a suitable reduction of the amino acid alphabet from 20 to 10 letters is made, but that this information is rapidly degraded when further reductions in the alphabet are made.},

Our present understanding on the molecular determinants of protein aggregation has crystalized in a series of predictive algorithms to identify aggregation-prone sites. A majority of these methods rely only on sequence. Therefore, they find difficulties to predict the aggregation properties of folded globular proteins, where aggregation-prone sites are often not contiguous in sequence or buried inside the native structure. The AGGRESCAN3D (A3D) server overcomes these limitations by taking into account the protein structure and the experimental aggregation propensity scale from the well-established AGGRESCAN method. Using the A3D server, the identified aggregation-prone residues can be virtually mutated to design variants with increased solubility, or to test the impact of pathogenic mutations. Additionally, A3D server enables to take into account the dynamic fluctuations of protein structure in solution, which may influence aggregation propensity. This is possible in A3D Dynamic Mode that exploits the CABS-flex approach for the fast simulations of flexibility of globular proteins.

The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed beta-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using ROSETTADESIGN, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of approximately 80\% with a P value of approximately 10(-12) when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein aggregation correlates with the development of several debilitating human disorders of growing incidence, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. On the biotechnological side, protein production is often hampered by the accumulation of recombinant proteins into aggregates. Thus, the development of methods to anticipate the aggregation properties of polypeptides is receiving increasing attention. AGGRESCAN is a web-based software for the prediction of aggregation-prone segments in protein sequences, the analysis of the effect of mutations on protein aggregation propensities and the comparison of the aggregation properties of different proteins or protein sets. RESULTS: AGGRESCAN is based on an aggregation-propensity scale for natural amino acids derived from in vivo experiments and on the assumption that short and specific sequence stretches modulate protein aggregation. The algorithm is shown to identify a series of protein fragments involved in the aggregation of disease-related proteins and to predict the effect of genetic mutations on their deposition propensities. It also provides new insights into the differential aggregation properties displayed by globular proteins, natively unfolded polypeptides, amyloidogenic proteins and proteins found in bacterial inclusion bodies. CONCLUSION: By identifying aggregation-prone segments in proteins, AGGRESCAN http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/ shall facilitate (i) the identification of possible therapeutic targets for anti-depositional strategies in conformational diseases and (ii) the anticipation of aggregation phenomena during storage or recombinant production of bioactive polypeptides or polypeptide sets.},

Each type of amino acid residue is assigned a numerical hydrophobicity, and the correlation coefficient rH is computed between all pairs of residues in the two sequences. In tests on sequences from two properly aligned proteins of similar three-dimensional structures, rH is found in the range 0.3 to 0.7. Improperly aligned sequences or unrelated sequences give rH near zero. By considering the observed frequency of amino acid replacements among related structures, a set of optimal matching hydrophobicities (OMHs) was derived. With this set of OMHs, significant correlation coefficients are calculated for similar three-dimensional structures, even though the two sequences contain few identical residues. An example is the two similar folding domains of rhodanese (rH = 0.5). Predictions are made of similar three-dimensional structures for the alpha and beta chains of the various phycobiliproteins, and for delta hemolysin and melittin.},

This is mainly because proteins that can undergo structural changes, which lead to amyloid formation, are quite diverse and share no obvious sequence or structural homology, despite the structural similarity found in the fibrils. To address these issues, a novel approach based on recursive feature selection and feed-forward neural networks was undertaken to identify key features highly correlated with the self-assembly problem. This approach allowed the identification of seven physicochemical and biochemical properties of the amino acids highly associated with the self-assembly of peptides and proteins into amyloid-like fibrils (normalized frequency of β-sheet, normalized frequency of β-sheet from LG, weights for β-sheet at the window position of 1, isoelectric point, atom-based hydrophobic moment, helix termination parameter at position j+1 and ΔG° values for peptides extrapolated in 0 M urea). Moreover, these features enabled the development of a new predictor (available at  http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/appnn/index.html ) capable of accurately and reliably predicting the amyloidogenic propensity from the polypeptide sequence alone with a prediction accuracy of 84.9 \% against an external validation dataset of sequences with experimental  in vitro , evidence of amyloid formation.},

Amyloid deposition in human tissue—amyloidosis—is associated with a number of diseases including all common dementias and type II diabetes. Considerable progress has been made to understand the mechanisms leading to amyloid formation. It is, however, not yet clear by which mechanisms amyloid and protein aggregates formed on the path to amyloid are cytotoxic. Strategies to prevent protein aggregation and amyloid formation are nevertheless, in many cases, promising and even successful. This review covers research on intervention of amyloidosis and highlights several examples of how inhibition of protein aggregation and amyloid formation has been achieved in practice. For instance, rational design can provide drugs that stabilize a native folded state of a protein, protein engineering can provide new binding proteins that sequester monomeric peptides from aggregation, small molecules and peptides can be designed to block aggregation or direct it into non-cytotoxic paths, and monoclonal antibodies have been developed for therapies towards neurodegenerative diseases based on inhibition of amyloid formation and clearance.},

We employ the Information Maximization Device, based on information theory, to partition the amino acids into well-defined clusters. Numbering from 2 to 19 groups, these optimal clusters of amino acids, while generated automatically, embody well-known properties of amino acids such as hydrophobicity/polarity, charge, size, and aromaticity, and are demonstrated to maintain the discriminative power of long-range interactions with minimal loss of mutual information. Our measurements suggest that reduced alphabets (of less than 10) are able to capture virtually all of the information residing in native contacts and may be sufficient for fold recognition, as demonstrated by extensive threading tests. In an expansive survey of the literature, we observe that alphabets derived from various approaches—including those derived from physicochemical intuition, local structure considerations, and sequence alignments of remote homologs—fare consistently well in preserving contact interaction information, highlighting a convergence in the various factors thought to be relevant to the folding code. Moreover, we find that alphabets commonly used in experimental protein design are nearly optimal and are largely coherent with observations that have arisen in this work.

	abstract = {A current barrier for successful rational drug design is the lack of understanding of the structure space provided by the proteins in a cell that is determined by their sequence space. The protein sequences capable of folding to functional three-dimensional shapes of the proteins are clearly different for different organisms, since sequences obtained from human proteins often fail to form correct three-dimensional structures in bacterial organisms. In analogy to the question "What kind of things do people say?" we therefore need to ask the question "What kind of amino acid sequences occur in the proteins of an organism?" An understanding of the sequence space occupied by proteins in different organisms would have important applications for "translation" of proteins from the language of one organism into that of another and design of drugs that target sequences that might be unique or preferred by pathogenic organisms over those in human hosts. Here we describe the development of a biological language modeling toolkit (BLMT) for genome-wide statistical amino acid n-gram analysis and comparison across organisms (freely accessible at www.cs.cmu.edu/{\textasciitilde}blmt). Its functions were applied to 44 different bacterial, archaeal and the human genome. Amino acid n-gram distribution was found to be characteristic of organisms, as evidenced by (1) the ability of simple Markovian unigram models to distinguish organisms, (2) the marked variation in n-gram distributions across organisms above random variation, and (3) identification of organism-specific phrases in protein sequences that are greater than an order of magnitude standard deviations away from the mean. These lines of evidence suggest that different organisms utilize different "vocabularies" and "phrases", an observation that may provide novel approaches to drug development by specifically targeting these phrases. The results suggest that further detailed analysis of n-gram statistics of protein sequences from whole genomes will likely - in analogy to word n-gram analysis - result in powerful models for prediction, topic classification and information extraction of bilogical sequences.},

One popular approach to representing these relationships is to divide the 20 amino acids of the standard genetic code into groups, thereby forming a simplified amino acid alphabet. Here, we develop a method to compare or combine different simplified alphabets, and apply it to 34 simplified alphabets from the scientific literature. We use this method to show that while different suggestions vary and agree in non-intuitive ways, they combine to reveal a consensus view of amino acid similarity that is clearly rooted in physico-chemistry.},

Prion-like conversion underlies important biological processes but is also connected to human disease. Yeast prions are the best understood transmissible amyloids. In these proteins, prion formation from an initially soluble state involves a structural conversion, driven, in many cases, by specific domains enriched in glutamine/asparagine (Q/N) residues. Importantly, domains sharing this compositional bias are also present in the proteomes of higher organisms, thus suggesting that prion-like conversion might be an evolutionary conserved mechanism. We have recently shown that the identification and evaluation of the potency of amyloid nucleating sequences in putative prion domains allows discrimination of genuine prions. PrionW is a web application that exploits this principle to scan sequences in order to identify proteins containing Q/N enriched prion-like domains (PrLDs) in large datasets. When used to scan the complete yeast proteome, PrionW identifies previously experimentally validated prions with high accuracy. Users can analyze up to 10 000 sequences at a time, PrLD-containing proteins are identified and their putative PrLDs and amyloid nucleating cores visualized and scored. The output files can be downloaded for further analysis. PrionW server can be accessed at http://bioinf.uab.cat/prionw/.},

Amyloid is a highly ordered form of protein aggregation that a wide variety of
                    proteins can form. While the earliest discovered amyloids were associated with
                    systemic and neurodegenerative diseases, recent findings indicate amyloids may
                    have myriad roles and functions ranging from learning and memory, to yeast
                    epigenetics, to biofilm and melanin production. In this study, we expand the
                    range and flexibility of our ability to understand how amyloid properties arise
                    from their polypeptide sequence. By taking advantage of the intrinsic properties
                    of a characteristic amyloid structure—parallel
                    β-strands—and data from available protein structures, we
                    construct and test an algorithm to predict the probability that particular
                    portions of a protein will form amyloid. Our method has the advantage of more
                    accurate detection of the edges of such zones, as well as the ability to
                    consider and evaluate the likelihood of multiple folding patterns.},

Despite their diversity, all amyloid proteins can undergo aggregation initiated by 6- to 15-residue segments, called hot spots. To find the patterns defining the hot-spots, we trained predictors of amyloidogenicity, using n-grams and random forest classifiers, based on data collected in the AmyLoad database. Only the most informative n-grams, selected by our Quick Permutation Test, were considered. Since the amyloidogenicity may not depend on the exact sequence of amino acids but on more general properties of amino acids, we tested 524,284 reduced amino acid alphabets of different lengths (three to six letters) to find the alphabet providing the best performance in cross-validation. The predictor based on this alphabet, called AmyloGram, was benchmarked against the most popular tools for the detection of amyloid peptides using an external data set and obtained the highest values of performance measures (AUC: 0.90, MCC: 0.63). Our results showed sequential patterns in the amyloids, which are strongly correlated with hydrophobicity, a tendency to form ß-sheets and rigidity of amino acid residues. Among the most informative n-grams of AmyloGram we identified 15 that were already confirmed experimentally. AmyloGram is available as a web-server: www.smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/amylogram/.

In vitro, CsgC inhibited CsgA amyloid formation at substoichiometric concentrations and maintained CsgA in a non-β-sheet-rich conformation. Interestingly, CsgC inhibited amyloid assembly of human α-synuclein, but not Aβ42, in vitro. We identified a common D-Q-Φ-X0,1-G-K-N-ζ-E motif in CsgC client proteins that is not found in Aβ42.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-7-415},
	abstract = {Background
Percentage Identity (PID) is frequently quoted in discussion of sequence alignments since it appears simple and easy to understand. However, although there are several different ways to calculate percentage identity and each may yield a different result for the same alignment, the method of calculation is rarely reported. Accordingly, quantification of the variation in PID caused by the different calculations would help in interpreting PID values in the literature. In this study, the variation in PID was quantified systematically on a reference set of 1028 alignments generated by comparison of the protein three-dimensional structures. Since the alignment algorithm may also affect the range of PID, this study also considered the effect of algorithm, and the combination of algorithm and PID method.

Results
The maximum variation in PID due to the calculation method was 11.5\% while the effect of alignment algorithm on PID was up to 14.6\% across three popular alignment methods. The combined effect of alignment algorithm and PID calculation gave a variation of up to 22\% on the test data, with an average of 5.3\% ± 2.8\% for sequence pairs with {\textless} 30\% identity. In order to see which PID method was most highly correlated with structural similarity, four different PID calculations were compared to similarity scores (Sc) from the comparison of the corresponding protein three-dimensional structures. The highest correlation coefficient for a PID calculation was 0.80. In contrast, the more sophisticated Z-score calculated by reference to randomized sequences gave a correlation coefficient of 0.84.

Conclusion
Although it is well known amongst expert sequence analysts that PID is a poor score for discriminating between protein sequences, the apparent simplicity of the percentage identity score encourages its widespread use in establishing cutoffs for structural similarity. This paper illustrates that not only is PID a poor measure of sequence similarity when compared to the Z-score, but that there is also a large uncertainty in reported PID values. Since better alternatives to PID exist to quantify sequence similarity, these should be quoted where possible in preference to PID. The findings presented here should prove helpful to those new to sequence analysis, and in warning those who seek to interpret the value of a PID reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Amyloidogenic regions in polypeptide chains are very important because such regions are responsible for amyloid formation and aggregation. It is useful to be able to predict positions of amyloidogenic regions in protein chains.
RESULTS: Two characteristics (expected probability of hydrogen bonds formation and expected packing density of residues) have been introduced by us to detect amyloidogenic regions in a protein sequence. We demonstrate that regions with high expected probability of the formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds as well as regions with high expected packing density are mostly responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Our method (FoldAmyloid) has been tested on a dataset of 407 peptides (144 amyloidogenic and 263 non-amyloidogenic peptides) and has shown good performance in predicting a peptide status: amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic. The prediction based on the expected packing density classified correctly 75\% of amyloidogenic peptides and 74\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Two variants (averaging by donors and by acceptors) of prediction based on the probability of formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds gave a comparable efficiency. With a hybrid-scale constructed by merging the above three scales, our method is correct for 80\% of amyloidogenic peptides and for 72\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins where positions of amyloidogenic regions are known from experimental data has also been done. In the proteins, our method correctly finds 10 out of 11 amyloidogenic regions.

	abstract = {Curli are functional amyloid fibers assembled by enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. In E. coli, the polymerization of the major curli fiber subunit protein CsgA into an amyloid fiber depends on the minor curli subunit protein, CsgB. The outer membrane-localized CsgB protein shares ≈30\% sequence identity with the amyloid-forming protein CsgA, suggesting that CsgB might also have amyloidogenic properties. Here, we characterized the biochemical properties of CsgB and the molecular basis for CsgB-mediated nucleation of CsgA. Deletion analysis revealed that a CsgB molecule missing 19 amino acids from its C terminus (CsgBtrunc) was not outer membrane-associated, but secreted away from the cell. CsgBtrunc was overexpressed and purified from the extracellular milieu of cells as an SDS-soluble, nonaggregated protein. Soluble CsgBtrunc assembled into fibers that bound to the amyloid-specific dyes Congo red and thioflavin-T. CsgBtrunc fibers were able to seed soluble CsgA polymerization in vitro. CsgBtrunc displayed modest nucleator activity in vivo, as demonstrated by its ability to convert extracellular CsgA into an amyloid fiber. Unlike WT CsgB, CsgBtrunc was only able to act as a nucleator when cells were genetically manipulated to secrete higher concentrations of CsgA. This work represents a unique demonstration of functional amyloid nucleation and it suggests an elegant model for how E. coli guides efficient amyloid fiber formation on the cell surface.},
